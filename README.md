# F-14B Tomcat Control Panels

A few simpit control panels I build for DCS and MSFS2020.

* [AN/ARC-159(V) 1 UHF Control Panel](Radio Panel/README.md)
* [TACAN Panel](TACAN Panel/README.md)
* [AoA Indexer](AoA Indexer/README.md)

These control panels are built with Arduino compatible microcontroller board Pro Micro (5V/16MHz w/ ATmega32U4), and communicate to DCS with [DCS BIOS](https://github.com/dcs-bios/dcs-bios).
