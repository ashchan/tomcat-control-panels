# F-14B Tomcat Control Panels

A few simpit control panels I build for DCS World Microsoft Flight Simulator.

These control panels are built with Arduino compatible microcontroller board Pro Micro (5V/16MHz w/ ATmega32U4), and communicate to DCS with [DCS BIOS](https://github.com/dcs-bios/dcs-bios).
